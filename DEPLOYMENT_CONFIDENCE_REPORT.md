### **Why This Will Work in Deployment:**

1. **🎯 Focused Changes Only:** We made ONLY the requested changes - larger boxes and full text utilization
2. **🔍 Conflict Resolution:** Found and fixed the `AnswerOverrides.css` conflict that was causing previous failures
3. **✅ Build Verification:** All changes are present in the production CSS bundle
4. **🧪 CSS Specificity:** Used proper specificity and !important where needed
5. **📐 CSS Modules:** Leveraged the existing CSS modules architecture correctly
6. **🔄 Override Alignment:** Ensured all override files match the new sizing

### **Previous Failure Analysis:**
**Why it didn't work before:** The `AnswerOverrides.css` file was importing AFTER our changes and overriding them with the old smaller values (65/35 split, smaller minimums). This override file is imported in `Answer.tsx` and was silently reverting our changes.

**How we fixed it:** Updated `AnswerOverrides.css` to match our new larger sizing, ensuring consistency across all CSS files.

### **Deployment Commands Verified:**
```bash
# These commands all succeed:
cd frontend
npm run build        # ✅ Builds successfully  
npm run dev         # ✅ Starts dev server
npm start           # ✅ Production ready
```
