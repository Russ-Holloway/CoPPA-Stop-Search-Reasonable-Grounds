# CoPA Stop & Search Solution - Security Compliance Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive cybersecurity enhancements implemented to ensure the CoPA Stop & Search solution is fully compliant with the UK 14 Cloud Security Principles and Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF).

## Security Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Network Security Infrastructure

#### Virtual Network (VNET) Implementation
- **File**: `/infra/core/network/virtual-network.bicep`
- **Features**: 
  - Dedicated VNET with segmented subnets
  - App Service subnet with delegation for `Microsoft.Web/serverFarms`
  - Private endpoint subnet with disabled network policies
  - Network Security Group (NSG) integration

#### Network Security Groups (NSG)
- **File**: `/infra/core/network/network-security-group.bicep`
- **Security Rules**:
  - Allow HTTPS (443) inbound traffic
  - Allow HTTP (80) for redirection
  - Default deny all other inbound traffic
  - Follows principle of least privilege

### 2. Private Network Access

#### Private Endpoints
- **Implementation**: All Azure services now use private endpoints
- **Services Secured**:
  - Storage Account (Blob service)
  - Cognitive Services (OpenAI)
  - Azure Search Service
  - Key Vault
  - Cosmos DB
- **Benefits**: 
  - Eliminates internet exposure
  - Traffic remains within Microsoft backbone network
  - Complies with UK Cloud Security Principle 11 (External Interface Protection)

#### Private DNS Zones
- **Purpose**: Ensures proper name resolution for private endpoints
- **Zones Created**:
  - `privatelink.blob.{environment.suffixes.storage}` - Storage Account
  - `privatelink.cognitiveservices.azure.com` - Cognitive Services
  - `privatelink.search.windows.net` - Search Service
  - `privatelink.vaultcore.azure.net` - Key Vault
  - `privatelink.documents.azure.com` - Cosmos DB

### 3. Service-Level Security Enhancements

#### Storage Account Security
- **File**: `/infra/core/storage/storage-account.bicep`
- **Enhancements**:
  - Public network access disabled (`publicNetworkAccess: 'Disabled'`)
  - Enforced OAuth authentication (`defaultToOAuthAuthentication: true`)
  - Secure transfer required (`supportsHttpsTrafficOnly: true`)
  - Network ACLs with default deny action
  - Container-level access controls

#### Cognitive Services Security  
- **File**: `/infra/core/ai/cognitiveservices.bicep`
- **Enhancements**:
  - Public network access disabled
  - Network ACLs with restrictive default action
  - Managed identity integration
  - Secure API key management

#### Search Service Security
- **File**: `/infra/core/search/search-services.bicep` 
- **Enhancements**:
  - Public network access disabled
  - Private endpoint integration
  - Authentication through Azure AD or API keys
  - Secure admin key management

#### Cosmos DB Security
- **File**: `/infra/core/database/cosmos/cosmos-account.bicep`
- **Enhancements**:
  - Public network access disabled (`publicNetworkAccess: 'Disabled'`)
  - Azure Services network bypass enabled
  - Key-based metadata write access disabled
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation

### 4. Key Management & Secrets

#### Azure Key Vault Integration
- **File**: `/infra/core/security/key-vault.bicep`
- **Features**:
  - Public network access disabled
  - Private endpoint integration
  - RBAC-based access policies
  - Secure secrets management for application settings
  - Integration with App Service managed identity

### 5. Monitoring & Logging

#### Log Analytics Workspace
- **File**: `/infra/core/monitor/log-analytics-workspace.bicep`
- **Security Features**:
  - Public network access disabled for ingestion and query
  - Centralized logging for all Azure services
  - Security event monitoring
  - Audit trail maintenance

### 6. App Service Security

#### VNET Integration
- App Service integrated with dedicated subnet
- Outbound traffic routed through VNET
- Private communication with backend services
- Enhanced network isolation

#### Authentication & Authorization
- Microsoft Entra ID authentication
- EasyAuth configuration
- Managed identity for service-to-service authentication
- Secure token handling

- **Network Security**: Private networking, microsegmentation
- **Identity & Access**: Managed identities, RBAC implementation
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Centralized audit and monitoring

## Deployment Configuration

### Network Parameters
```json
{
  "enablePrivateEndpoints": true,
  "vnetAddressPrefix": "10.0.0.0/16",
  "appServiceSubnetAddressPrefix": "10.0.1.0/24", 
  "privateEndpointSubnetAddressPrefix": "10.0.2.0/24"
}
```

```bash
ENABLE_PRIVATE_ENDPOINTS=true
VNET_ADDRESS_PREFIX=10.0.0.0/16
APP_SERVICE_SUBNET_ADDRESS_PREFIX=10.0.1.0/24

```

## Verification Steps

1. **Network Isolation Verification**
   ```bash
   # Verify private endpoints are created
   az network private-endpoint list --resource-group <resource-group>
   
   # Verify NSG rules
   az network nsg show --resource-group <resource-group> --name <nsg-name>
   ```

2. **Service Security Verification**
   ```bash
   # Verify storage account public access is disabled
   az storage account show --name <storage-account> --resource-group <resource-group> --query publicNetworkAccess
   
   # Verify Cosmos DB public access is disabled
   az cosmosdb show --name <cosmos-account> --resource-group <resource-group> --query publicNetworkAccess
   ```

3. **VNET Integration Verification**
   ```bash
   # Verify App Service VNET integration
   az webapp vnet-integration list --name <app-service> --resource-group <resource-group>
   ```

## Security Benefits Achieved

1. **Zero Trust Architecture**: All services communicate through private endpoints
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
3. **Least Privilege Access**: RBAC and managed identities
4. **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Centralized logging and alerting
5. **Data Protection**: Encryption and secure key management
6. **Network Isolation**: Private communication channels
7. **Compliance Ready**: Meets UK government security requirements

## Post-Deployment Security Checklist
