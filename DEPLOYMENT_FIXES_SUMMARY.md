# Azure Deployment Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Azure OpenAI Resource Global Naming Conflict
**Problem:** The Azure OpenAI resource name `policing-assistant-openai-resource` was already taken globally, causing deployment failures.

**Solution:** Updated the ARM template to use a unique name generation:
```json
"AzureOpenAIResource": "[concat('policing-ai-', uniqueString(resourceGroup().id))]"
```

This ensures the resource name is globally unique by appending a hash based on the resource group ID.

### 2. API Version Compatibility Issues
**Problem:** The ARM template was using newer API versions that weren't supported:
- `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts` was using `2023-05-01` instead of `2017-04-18`
- `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/deployments` was using `2023-05-01` instead of `2021-10-01`

**Solution:** Updated all API versions to supported versions:
- Changed Azure OpenAI account API version from `2023-05-01` to `2017-04-18`
- Changed Azure OpenAI deployment API versions from `2023-05-01` to `2021-10-01`

### 3. Storage Account and Container Naming
**Problem:** Previous string length issues with dynamically generated names.

**Solution:** (Already fixed in previous updates)
- Storage account name: `stpolicing001` (fixed, 13 characters)
- Container name: `docs` (fixed, 4 characters)
- Both names are well within Azure limits and consistent across all templates

### 4. PowerShell Script Configuration
**Problem:** Search setup script had complex skillset configuration.

**Solution:** (Already fixed in previous updates)
- Simplified skillset to use only required skills:
  - `#Microsoft.Skills.Text.SplitSkill`
  - `#Microsoft.Skills.Text.AzureOpenAIEmbeddingSkill`

## Current Status

✅ **ARM Template Validation:** No errors found
✅ **API Versions:** All using supported versions
✅ **Resource Naming:** Globally unique names implemented
✅ **Storage Configuration:** Consistent naming across all files
✅ **Deploy Button:** Points to correct Azure Storage location with proper SAS tokens

## Files Modified

1. `infrastructure/deployment.json`
   - Fixed API versions for Azure OpenAI resources
   - Azure OpenAI resource name already uses unique generation

2. Previous fixes (already completed):
