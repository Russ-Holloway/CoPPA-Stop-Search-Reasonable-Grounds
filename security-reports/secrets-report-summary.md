# Security Report: Secrets Scan

**Status**: Scan completed but results too large for version control  
**File Size**: > 2GB  
**Location**: Excluded from git (see .gitignore)  

## Summary
The secrets scan generated an extremely large report file that exceeds GitHub's file size limits. The detailed results are available locally but not committed to the repository for performance and storage reasons.

## Key Findings
- Large number of potential matches found (likely many false positives)
- Results include extensive matches in node_modules and virtual environments
- Recommend running targeted scans on specific directories to reduce noise

## Recommendations
1. Configure gitleaks to exclude node_modules and venv directories
2. Use more targeted scanning patterns
3. Implement result filtering to reduce false positives
4. Store large reports separately from version control
