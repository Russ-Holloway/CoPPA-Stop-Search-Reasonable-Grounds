## Deployment

### PDS Compliant Deployment (For UK Police Forces)

**ðŸš” For all 44 UK Police Forces:** Use our simplified PDS-compliant deployment. Just create a resource group following PDS naming (e.g., `rg-btp-prod-01`) and deploy - all resource names are generated automatically!

**âœ… Compliance Features:**
- **PDS Naming Standards:** Automatic compliance with Police Digital Service naming conventions
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Accessibility:** Full accessibility compliance for inclusive access
- **Security Standards:** Enterprise-grade security with Azure best practices

[![Deploy PDS Compliant](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fstcoppadeployment02.blob.core.windows.net%2Fcoppa-deployment%2Fdeployment.json%3Fst%3D2025-07-23%26se%3D2026-07-23%26sp%3Drlpt%26spr%3Dhttps%26sv%3D2022-11-02%26ss%3Db%26srt%3Dsco%26sig%3DT8GTdzBqPHDxODY%2FUHs7rlDPVFIgNOkHIi1pRAwtw4E%253D/createUIDefinitionUri/https%3A%2F%2Fstcoppadeployment02.blob.core.windows.net%2Fcoppa-deployment%2FcreateUiDefinition-pds.json%3Fst%3D2025-07-23%26se%3D2026-07-23%26sp%3Drlpt%26spr%3Dhttps%26sv%3D2022-11-02%26ss%3Db%26srt%3Dsco%26sig%3DT8GTdzBqPHDxODY%2FUHs7rlDPVFIgNOkHIi1pRAwtw4E%253D)

**ðŸŽ¯ Simplified Deployment Process:**
1. **Create Resource Group:** Use PDS naming like `rg-btp-prod-01`, `rg-met-prod-01`, etc.
2. **Click Deploy:** All Azure resources are automatically created with PDS-compliant names
3. **Choose OpenAI Models:** Select your preferred chat and embedding models
4. **Deploy:** Infrastructure deployment completes automatically!
5. **Deploy Code:** Upload your application code to the created App Service (manual step)

### Post-Deployment Setup

After infrastructure deployment completes, you need to deploy your application code and configure authentication.

#### Code Deployment (Required)
The ARM template creates the Azure infrastructure but doesn't automatically deploy application code. You have several options:

**Option 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended)**
```yaml
# Set up GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment
- uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
  with:
    app-name: 'your-app-name'
    package: '.'
```

**Option 2: Azure CLI**
```bash
# Deploy using Azure CLI
az webapp deployment source config-zip \
  --resource-group your-resource-group \
  --name your-app-name \
  --src app.zip
```

**Option 3: Visual Studio Code**
- Install Azure App Service extension
- Right-click on your app folder and select "Deploy to Web App"

**ðŸ“– Full Guide:** [Code Deployment Guide](docs/code-deployment-guide.md)

#### Authentication Setup (Required)
**ðŸš€ Quick Setup:** Run the automated authentication script:
```powershell
.\scripts\setup_azure_ad_auth.ps1 -WebAppName "your-web-app-name" -ResourceGroupName "your-resource-group"
```

**ðŸ“‹ Quick Reference:** [Azure AD Quick Reference](AZURE_AD_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)  
**ðŸ“– Full Guide:** [Azure AD Setup Guide](AZURE_AD_SETUP_GUIDE.md)

#### Search Components Setup (Required)
After infrastructure deployment, you'll need to manually configure the Azure Cognitive Search components:

```powershell
.\scripts\setup-search-components.ps1 -ResourceGroupName "your-resource-group-name" -SearchServiceName "your-search-service-name" -StorageAccountName "your-storage-account-name" -OpenAIServiceName "your-openai-service-name"
```

This will create:
- Search index with vector search capabilities
- Data source connected to blob storage
- Skillsets for document processing and embedding generation
- Indexers to process documents

## Note on Deploy to Azure Button

The "Deploy to Azure" button requires that the ARM template (deployment.json) be accessible via a public URL with CORS enabled. The template is hosted in a secure Azure Storage account with proper CORS configuration.

To make the "Deploy to Azure" button work:

1. The deployment.json file is hosted on a public storage service with CORS enabled (Azure Blob Storage configured for public access with CORS)
2. A clean, simple URL structure is used without complex query parameters
3. The URL is properly encoded in the markdown link

---

## Troubleshooting Deployment

If you encounter issues during deployment, please try the following:

### Authentication Errors
If you see authentication errors when using the one-click deployment button:
1. Make sure you're logged into Azure before clicking the button
2. Check that your Azure account has the necessary permissions to deploy resources

### Access Denied Errors
If you encounter access denied errors when accessing the template:
1. Make sure the SAS token for the blob storage hasn't expired
2. Try refreshing the page and clicking the deployment button again

### Deployment Parameter Errors
If you encounter errors related to missing or invalid parameters:
1. Make sure to fill in all required parameters in the Azure Portal
2. For sensitive values like API keys, ensure they are entered correctly
3. For region-specific resources, ensure the selected region supports all required services

For additional assistance, please contact your system administrator.
