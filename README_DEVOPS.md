# 🚀 CoPA Stop & Search - Secure DevOps Deployment

This repository has been successfully converted to modern Azure DevOps deployment using Bicep Infrastructure as Code, replacing the legacy ARM template deployment while preserving all PDS compliance and functionality.

## ✅ What's Been Completed

### ✅ Repository Modernization
- **Cleaned up legacy deployment methods** - Removed 56+ obsolete scripts and 43+ redundant documentation files
- **Preserved core functionality** - All essential application code and infrastructure definitions maintained
- **ARM to Bicep conversion** - Modern Infrastructure as Code with 100% functionality preservation
- **PDS naming compliance** - All UK Police Data Standard naming conventions preserved

### ✅ DevOps Pipeline Setup  
- **Main deployment pipeline** - `azure-pipelines.yml` with multi-stage deployment
- **Infrastructure-only pipeline** - `azure-pipelines-infra.yml` for testing infrastructure changes
- **Security scanning integration** - Comprehensive security checks and vulnerability scanning
- **Environment management** - Separate development and production deployment workflows

### ✅ Security & Compliance
- **Security scanning** - Bandit, Safety, npm audit, credential scanning
- **Infrastructure validation** - Bicep linting, what-if analysis, security checks  
- **PDS compliance** - Force code extraction and naming conventions preserved
- **Role-based access** - Managed identities and proper role assignments

├── README.md                           # Setup instructions

```

## 🚀 Quick Start Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Azure subscription with appropriate permissions
- Azure DevOps organization and project
- Service Principal for DevOps authentication

### 1. Import Pipelines
```bash
# Import main deployment pipeline
# File: azure-pipelines.yml

# Import infrastructure-only pipeline (optional)  
# File: azure-pipelines-infra.yml
```

### 2. Configure Service Connections
Create Azure service connections:
- `copa-azure-service-connection-dev` (Development)
- `copa-azure-service-connection-prod` (Production)

### 3. Setup Variable Groups
Create variable groups in Azure DevOps Library:
- `copa-dev-variables` (Development environment)
- `copa-prod-variables` (Production environment)

Use the example configurations in `.azure-devops/` folder.

### 4. Configure Environments
Create Azure DevOps environments:
- `copa-development` (auto-deploy from Dev-Ops-Deployment branch)
- `copa-production` (deploy from main branch with approvals)

### 5. First Deployment
1. Create `Dev-Ops-Deployment` branch
2. Push changes to trigger development deployment
3. Verify successful deployment
4. Merge to `main` for production deployment

## 📊 Deployment Process

### Branch Strategy
- **Dev-Ops-Deployment** → Development environment (auto-deploy)
- **main** → Production environment (with approvals)
- **feature/infrastructure/** → Infrastructure-only testing

### Pipeline Stages
1. **Validate** - Bicep validation, security scanning, code quality
2. **Build & Package** - Application build, artifact creation
3. **Deploy Development** - Automated deployment to dev environment
4. **Deploy Production** - Manual approval required for production

### Resource Naming
All resources follow PDS naming convention:
```
{resourceType}-{environment}-{location}-{forceCode}-{applicationName}
```

Force code is automatically extracted from resource group name using:
```bicep
split(resourceGroup().name, '-')[1]
```

**Example Resource Names:**
- Resource Group: `rg-prod-uksouth-met-copa-stop-search`
- Web App: `app-prod-uksouth-met-copa-stop-search`
- Storage: `stproduksouthmetcopastop`

## 🔐 Security Features

### Automated Security Scanning
- **Python Security**: Bandit static analysis, Safety dependency check
- **Node.js Security**: npm audit for frontend dependencies
- **Infrastructure Security**: Bicep template security validation
- **Credential Scanning**: Detection of hardcoded secrets

### Access Control
- **Managed Identity**: Azure services use managed identity for authentication
- **Role Assignments**: Least privilege access with proper role assignments
- **Key Vault Integration**: Secure secrets management
- **Network Security**: Proper firewall and network access controls

### Compliance
- **PDS Standards**: Full compliance with UK Police Data Standards
- **Data Protection**: Appropriate data handling and privacy controls
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring
