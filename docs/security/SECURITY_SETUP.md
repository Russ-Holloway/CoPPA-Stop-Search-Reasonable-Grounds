# CoPA Security Setup Guide

This document provides comprehensive security setup instructions for the CoPA application.

## Overview

The CoPA application implements multiple layers of security to protect sensitive police data:

- **Secret Detection**: Automated scanning for hardcoded credentials
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular dependency and container security checks  
- **Infrastructure Security**: ARM template validation and compliance checks
- **Code Security**: Static analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **Compliance Monitoring**: PDS and regulatory compliance verification

## Security Tools Installed

- ✅ **Gitleaks**: Secret detection and prevention
- ✅ **Trivy**: Vulnerability scanning for containers and dependencies
- ✅ **Hadolint**: Dockerfile security best practices
- ✅ **Safety**: Python dependency vulnerability scanning

## Daily Security Tasks

1. **Review Security Alerts**: Check automated scan results
2. **Monitor Failed Authentication**: Review authentication logs  
3. **System Health Check**: Verify all security tools are functioning
