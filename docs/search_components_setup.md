# Azure Cognitive Search Setup Guide

This guide explains how Azure Cognitive Search components are configured for the CoPPA application. Search components are **automatically set up during deployment**, but this guide provides information for troubleshooting or manual reconfiguration if needed.

## Automated Setup Process

When you deploy CoPPA using the "Deploy to Azure" button, the search components are automatically configured through:

1. **ARM Template Deployment Script**: A PowerShell script runs during deployment to create and configure all search components
2. **Application Startup Configuration**: Additional setup happens during the web app's first startup

**No manual setup is required** under normal circumstances.

## When to Use Manual Setup

You only need to manually set up search components if:
- The automatic setup failed during deployment
- You need to recreate or reconfigure components
- You're deploying in a customized environment

## Setup Options

You can set up Azure Cognitive Search components using either:
- **Option A**: PowerShell Script (for manual troubleshooting)
- **Option B**: Manual Azure Portal Configuration

## Option A: PowerShell Script Setup (For Troubleshooting)

If you need to manually set up or recreate the Azure Cognitive Search components, you can use our PowerShell script.

### Prerequisites for Script Usage

- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- Azure CLI installed and configured
- Appropriate permissions to create resources in your Azure subscription

### Running the Script

1. Navigate to the CoPPA repository root directory
2. Run the setup script:

```powershell
.\scripts\setup-search-components.ps1 -ResourceGroupName "your-resource-group-name" -SearchServiceName "your-search-service-name" -StorageAccountName "your-storage-account-name" -OpenAIServiceName "your-openai-service-name"
```

### Script Parameters

- **ResourceGroupName**: The name of your Azure resource group
- **SearchServiceName**: The name of your Azure Cognitive Search service
- **StorageAccountName**: The name of your Azure Storage account (must be globally unique)
- **OpenAIServiceName**: The name of your Azure OpenAI service

### What the Script Does

The script will:
1. Create a storage account with a "documents" container
2. Set up the search index with proper fields and vector search configuration
3. Create data sources for document indexing
4. Configure skillsets for text processing and AI enrichment
5. Set up indexers to process and index documents
6. Upload sample documents (if available in the data folder)
7. Run the initial indexing process

### Example Usage

```powershell
.\scripts\setup-search-components.ps1 -ResourceGroupName "coppa-rg" -SearchServiceName "coppa-search" -StorageAccountName "coppastorage123" -OpenAIServiceName "coppa-openai"
```

**Note:** This script is the same script used by the ARM template during deployment.

## Option B: Manual Azure Portal Configuration

If you prefer to configure the components manually or need to customize the setup, follow these detailed steps:

## Manual Setup Steps

### 1. Create a Storage Account for Document Storage

1. Go to the Azure Portal and navigate to your resource group
2. Click "Create" and search for "Storage account"
3. Create a new storage account with the following settings:
   - Name: Choose a unique name (must be globally unique)
   - Performance: Standard
   - Redundancy: Locally-redundant storage (LRS)
   - Other settings: Default
4. Once created, navigate to the storage account
5. Go to "Containers" and create a new container named "documents"
6. Set the access level to "Private"

### 2. Upload Documents

1. In the "documents" container, upload your policing-related documents
2. These can be PDF, Word, PowerPoint, text files, etc.

### 3. Create a Search Index

1. Navigate to your Azure Cognitive Search service that was created by the ARM template
2. Go to "Indexes" and click "Add index"
3. Use the following configuration:
   - Index name: policingindex
   - Configure your fields as follows:
     - id (Key, Retrievable)

     - filename (Retrievable, Searchable, Sortable)
     - metadata_author (Retrievable, Searchable, Filterable)
     - metadata_creation_date (Retrievable, Filterable, Sortable)
     - category (Retrievable, Searchable, Filterable, Facetable)
     - contentVector (Collection(Edm.Single), Searchable, Vector dimensions: 1536, Vector search config: vectorConfig)
   - Configure vector search settings:
     - Name: vectorConfig
     - Algorithm: HNSW
     - Parameters: m=4, efConstruction=400, efSearch=500, metric=cosine
   - Configure semantic search settings:
     - Configuration name: default
     - Title field: title
     - Content fields: content
     - Keyword fields: category

### 4. Create a Data Source

1. In your search service, go to "Data sources" and click "New data source"
2. Configure as follows:
   - Name: policingdata
   - Source: Azure Blob Storage
   - Connection string: Use the connection string from your storage account
   - Container: documents
   - Blob folder: Leave empty to include all documents
   - Description: Policing documents data source

### 5. Create the Text Processing Skillset

1. Go to "Skillsets" and click "New skillset"
2. Configure as follows:
   - Name: policing-text-skillset
   - Description: Text processing skillset for policing documents
   - Add the following skills:
     - **Split Skill**:
       - Source field: /document/content
       - Maximum page length: 5000
       - Output field name: pages

     - Configuration > Parsing mode: Default

### 8. Run the Indexer

1. Select your newly created indexer
2. Click "Run" to start the indexing process
3. Monitor the progress in the indexer status

### 9. Update App Configuration

1. Navigate to your Web App in the Azure Portal
2. Go to Configuration > Application settings
3. Update the following settings:
   - AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX: policingindex
   - AZURE_SEARCH_QUERY_TYPE: vector or vectorSemanticHybrid (depending on your preference)
   - AZURE_SEARCH_VECTOR_COLUMNS: contentVector
   - AZURE_SEARCH_USE_SEMANTIC_SEARCH: true (if using semantic search)

## Verification

### For Automated Setup
After running the PowerShell script:
1. Check the script output for any error messages
2. Verify in the Azure Portal that all resources were created successfully
3. Test the search functionality in your CoPPA application

### For Manual Setup
1. Once the indexer has finished running, go to your search service
2. Select "Search explorer"
3. Run a test query to verify your documents are being indexed properly
4. Try the search functionality in your CoPPA application

## Adding More Documents

### With Automated Setup
- Upload documents directly to the "documents" container in your storage account
- The indexer will automatically process new documents based on the configured schedule

### With Manual Setup
- Upload documents to the storage container you configured
- Manually run the indexer or wait for the scheduled run

## Troubleshooting

### Automated Setup Issues
If the PowerShell script fails:
1. Check that you have the correct permissions for all services
2. Verify that Azure CLI is properly configured (`az login`)
3. Ensure all service names are correct and resources exist
4. Check the script output for specific error messages
5. Try running individual Azure CLI commands manually to isolate issues

### Manual Setup Issues
If you encounter issues with manual configuration:
1. Check the indexer status for error messages
2. Verify all connection strings and keys are correct
3. Ensure your documents can be parsed properly
4. Check that the field mappings are configured correctly

### General Issues
- Verify that your Azure OpenAI service has the required models deployed
- Ensure the embedding model deployment name matches your configuration
- Check that the search service has sufficient capacity for your document volume
